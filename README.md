Old Portfolio website. Good intentions but poor execution.

Problems include:
- Navigation of user interface is unclear
- No menu to quickly navigate to different sections - sluggish navigation
- Purpose is unclear - should present method of contact/work/profession immediately or at least more quickly
- Email portion in the contact section doesn't function - too ambitious at the time without use of a plugin
- Not compliant with accessibility standards
- Code for several onClick elements are abusable
- Scales poorly for smaller screens
- Probably more...

Knowledge demonstrated:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaSript
- jQuery
- jQueryUI
